## Installation

To install the project, you need to follow these commands:

Using this command will allow you to clone the project and open it in your code editor for easy development and modification

```bash
  git clone URL's project
```

The following command will download the modules so that you can run the project.

```bash
  npm install
```

To finally run the project, just write down this command:
```bash
  npm run dev
```


## How can I add features?
To start creating a feature for our project, we need a structure. The following commands and instructions will help you create a new one:

Remember that you always have to download the latest updates from the main branch, so you need to run the following command:
```bash
  git pull origin main
```

Now, once you have downloaded all updates, you need to create a branch and change into it using the following command:

```bash
  git checkout -b Feature/EC-(Jira's Task Number)/Feature's Name
```

When you're done with your feature, you need to upload the changes using the following command:

```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "" (Remember that you have to follow the conventional commits rules)
  git push origin Feature/EC-(Jira's Task Number)/Feature's Name
```



And now you just have to create a Pull Request on GitHub and wait for the admins to approve or reject your pull request
